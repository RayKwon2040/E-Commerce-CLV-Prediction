# E-Commerce-CLV-Prediction

## Introduction 

The e-commerce customer dataset includes 13 variables, such as purchase date, purchase amount, product category, quantity, returns, churn status, and others.

Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a critical metric because it enables businesses to make smarter, data-driven decisions that foster customer loyalty, reduce acquisition costs, and ensure sustainable profitability. As a result, CLV is a cornerstone metric for long-term business success.

The objective of this project is to develop a CLV prediction model. By leveraging this model, the e-commerce company can make strategic decisions based on predicted CLV. For example, discounts can be offered to customers with low predicted CLV to boost engagement, while loyalty programs can be targeted toward high-CLV customers.
